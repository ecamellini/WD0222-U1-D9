## 1) Representing and manipulating data

- We can store data in **variables**. Variables are like containers for our data, their value can change over time.
- Data can be represented using values that are part of a set of data types. We can have primitive data types, and "structural" data types.

### Primitive data types

1. `number`: `2`, `2.15`, `-12`, `NaN`, `Infinity`
2. `string`: `"Hello"`, `'Another one'`, ``Another string``
3. `boolean`: `true` or `false`
4. `null`
5. `undefined`

### Represing structured data

1. Objects: we use them to represent different properties all related to the same entity, to the same "thing". Properties have a name and a value, they can have different data types, you use the name access them, modify them, etc.
2. Arrays: we use them to represent a list of items, all with the same data type. We access the items using their position, their index, in the list (a number). We can use loops to iterate through the elements, to do something for each element. The order of the elements matters.

We can compose arrays, objects, and prmitives, as we want, also nesting arrays in objects, arrays in arrays, objects in objects, etc.
